  abstract  = "Nowadays hybrid recommender systems are used, which utilize both
               collaborative and content based filtering techniques unlike the
               FoF system that have been presented in the chapter. Social
               networking services (SNSs) provide a platform where likeminded
               people interact and express opinions. The trends of socializing
               have changed drastically and the general population is turning
               to these services to socialize and network with new people.
               Massive infrastructure compliments uninterrupted usage of these
               services. Owing to the rapidly growing user base of SNSs, there
               is always a need to improve upon the existing infrastructure to
               keep cost and performance in tune with one another. GPUs are
               proving to be a viable solution to bridge the gap between the
               two. In this chapter, we describe GPU implementation of a Friend
               recommender system which is based on content-based filtering
               mechanism. It has given significant speed up from its previous
               counterparts, thus making the whole process more efficient.",

  abstract  = "With the advancement of portable devices and sensors, there has
               been a need to build a universal framework, which can serve as a
               nodal point to aggregate data from different kinds of devices
               and sensors. We propose a unified framework that will provide a
               robust set of guidelines for sensors with varied degree of
               complexities connected to common set of System-on-Chip (SoC).
               These will help to monitor, control and visualize real time data
               coming from different type of sensors connected to these SoCs.
               We have defined a set of APIs, which will help the sensors to
               register with the server. These APIs will be the standard to
               which the sensors will comply while streaming data when
               connected to the client platforms.",

abstract="Data analytics in healthcare applications play an important role as it gives insights into various aspects. In the present digital world, many gadgets are used for health monitoring. The data from these devices need to be collected in a careful manner as the privacy of the data also needs to be ensured. Machine learning methods such as clustering, random forests can be used for the analysis of various healthcare records. The patterns and trends in data become much more useful to predict and analyze data specifically in the sphere of healthcare. The aim of this chapter is to provide the different data science-oriented tools and methods for healthcare analytics. A case study on the usage of different tools and techniques is also presented at the end of the chapter that provides the complete life-cycle of the analytics phase for healthcare applications.",
